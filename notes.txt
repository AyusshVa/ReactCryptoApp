Context api: 
steps: 
1. Make a new file named: CryptoContext.js
2. import {createContext} from 'react'; 
3. const ContextName = createContext(); 
4. const CryptoContext = ({children})=>{
    const [state1, setState1] = useState(null); 
    const [state2, setState2] = useState(null); 
    return (
        <ContextName.provider value={{state1, state2, setState1 etc}} >
            {children}
        </ContextName.provider>
    )
}
5. Wrap the App componet in the index.js with the CryptoContext tags. (first import it in index)
6. To send the state to different components in the application: use the hook useContext(ContextName); 
7. export const CryptoState = ()=>{
    return useContext(ContextName);  --> this will contain all the state variables defined in the CrptyoContext function
      // import {useContext} from 'react' 
}
